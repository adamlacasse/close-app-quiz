# Hello to the folks at Close! ðŸ‘‹
### This is the repo for my version of the Frontend Application Quiz
I do not have much experience with JSFiddle and I could get the final app running only by pasting the minified React code, which is obviously not readable.

But [here it is anyway](https://jsfiddle.net/adamlacasse/ve63xo1k/9/) if you'd like to see it in that format.

The best experience will be to look at the code in this repo, and the deployed app [here](https://close-app-quiz-9shiabcii-adamlacasse.vercel.app/).

Thanks for your time, and I appreciate your consideration!

Cheers,
Adam LaCasse
